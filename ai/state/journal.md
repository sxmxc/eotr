- Summary: Guarded battle-over handling so we only emit the screen once, paused battle music, and forced win/lose stingers to start at full volume even when the tree is paused.
- Files: `scenes/game_world/game_world.gd`, `ui/world_ui/battle_over_panel.gd`, `ai/planning/todo.yaml`, `ai/state/progress.json`
- Verification: Not run (Godot headless/audio checks not executed here).
- Follow-ups: Verify in-game that the victory/defeat audio plays immediately on the battle over screen and stops cleanly when moving to rewards/map; keep an ear out for any remaining overlap with battle playlists.
